## Introduction

LeetCode is a platform for practicing coding problems that range from easy to hard and cover a wide array of topics such as algorithms, data structures, SQL, and more. This repository contains solutions to problems I’ve worked on, with explanations and approaches included where necessary.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
.
|-- Easy/
|   |-- <problem-name>.ext
|-- Medium/
|   |-- <problem-name>.ext
|-- Hard/
|   |-- <problem-name>.ext
|-- SQL/
|   |-- <problem-name>.sql
|-- README.md
```

- **Easy/**: Contains solutions to problems categorized as "Easy."
- **Medium/**: Contains solutions to problems categorized as "Medium."
- **Hard/**: Contains solutions to problems categorized as "Hard."
- **SQL/**: Contains solutions to SQL problems.

Each solution file is named according to the problem it solves (e.g., `two-sum.py`).
